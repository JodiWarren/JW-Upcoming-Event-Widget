# JW's Simple Countdown Widget

A simple countdown widget. Users can set a widget title, event name, date, time, and live message. Widget will countdown live to that date & time.

## Description

This widget can be used to count down to live events, such as a concert, a liveblog, or a TV show. While it was built for a music site, there's nothing to stop it being used in any countdown situation.

Users can set a title, event name, date, time and live message. You can use relatively smart plain text to describe the time, and the date uses a datepicker to make it really easy.

Once you've set it, it will appear in the sidebar of your site, and tick down, second by second, until the countdown is over. Then it'll display a customised message.

## Installation

Once installed, just activate the plugin and attach the widget to your sidebar. No coding needed!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this require Javascript?

Javascript is very common nowadays, and should be expected to be used. However, if the user doesn't have it enabled, they'll simply get a static display of the remaining time.

### My time's wrong!

This plugin relies on your server having the correct time set. If it's off, or the time zone is different to your locale, it won't currently work. Hopefully I'll come up with a solution to that.

### Err, this isn't working with my translation plugin!

Sorry! I really want to get to this very soon, but haven't had time yet.

### How do I change the "Live in: " text?

Once again, apologies - you can't currently do so. You could edit the widget.js and the widget.php files for the time being.
